      Above is the flag of my country. Yes, I am from Singapore. I was a student from Ngee Ann Polytechnic and I studied electrical engineering. 
      My hobbies are watching movies and going out with my family. I joined this course because there were so many ads online about software engineering. So I guess, I give it a shot.
